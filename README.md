# Performance-prediction-of-battery-management-system-for-Electric-Vehicles

Electric vehicles (EVs) have seen a rapid rise in popularity due to their environmental benefits and energy
efficiency. However, accurate prediction and estimation of the state of charge (SOC) of batteries used in EVs is critical for
efficient battery management.  

This project focuses on the development of deep neural network (DNN) models, namely LSTM, CNN, WDNN and CNN, for the purpose of
predicting and estimating the state of charge (SOC) of batteries used in electric vehicles (EVs).  

The dataset used for training and testing the DNN models comprises of 8 lakh data points and contains five features, namely voltage, current, temperature, average voltage, and average current, with the target variable being the SOC. 

The performance of the models is evaluated using various metrics, such as mean absolute error (MAE), maximum absolute error, and root mean squared error (RMSE).
